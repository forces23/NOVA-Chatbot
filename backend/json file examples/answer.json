    "result": "Medicaid (referred to as MO HealthNet in Missouri) is a federal-state partnership program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals and families. Some key points about Medicaid from the given context:\n\n- Medicaid is called Title XIX (19) of the Social Security Act.\n- It is administered by states within federal guidelines, so the specific services and eligibility criteria can vary from state to state.\n- In Missouri, MO HealthNet is administered by the Department of Social Services (DSS), and claims are processed by a state-contracted fiscal agent.\n- Individuals can apply for MO HealthNet benefits through the Family Support Division (FSD) in Missouri.\n- The federal government provides a share of funding (Federal Financial Participation or FFP) to states for their Medicaid expenditures, with no set limit on the total federal payment.\n- The federal funding share for Medicaid varies, typically ranging from 60% to 90%, with the state covering the remaining portion from its own funds.\n- Medicaid covers certain medically necessary services for eligible children with disabilities, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and others, when included in their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and provided by qualified Medicaid providers.\n\nIn summary, Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals, with states administering their specific programs according to federal guidelines and with partial federal funding support.",

MO  HealthNet (Medicaid) is also called Title XIX (19) of the Social Security Act. Each  state designs and operates its own program within federal guidelines; therefore,  programs vary among states. In Missouri, an individual may apply for MO  HealthNet benefits through the Family Support Division (FSD). Additional  information can be found on the FSD website.
